## Agami: Scalable Streaming Visualization

(Collaboration with the USF [VGL](https://vgl.cs.usfca.edu))

Agami provides live-updating, interactive visualizations over
streaming data. We leverage in-memory data sketches to summarize and aggregate information
to be visualized, and also allow users to query future feature values by leveraging online
machine learning models. Our approach facilitates low-latency, iterative exploration of data
streams and can scale out incrementally to handle increasing stream velocities and query
loads.

[Visit the Github Organization](https://github.com/agami-viz) for more information about the project.

## Quantum Criticism

Conceived by [Ted Gioia](https://theodoregioia.com/), Quantum Criticism is an umbrella of projects around news data and analysis. This includes sub-projects:

* Core QC -- collecting the text of digital print articles from various news sources, including the Atlantic, the BBC, Breitbart News, Fox News, NY Times, Reuters, Slate Magazine and others. These articles are analysed for sentiment on an article level, paragaraph level and sentence level.
* News KG -- a searchable knowledge graph of news articles in the QC database
* Perspective -- a project to determine the various perspectives (eg. political or demographic interests) of a news story as reported in different sources.
