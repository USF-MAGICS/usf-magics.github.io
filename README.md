# USF MAGICS Lab

Hello world :-)

## Who are we?
The MAGICS LAB was founded in 2018 by Drs. Brizan (Computer Science), Intrevado (Data Science), and Malensek (Computer Science) at the University of San Francisco. We meet weekly with undergraduate and graduate students to work on applied research.

## What do we do?
We work on projects that have great personal interest to us, including:
* Detecting Bias is News Organisations
* Classifying Songs by Genre
* Improving upon the Yelp recommendation engine for restaurants
* Analysing personal and cultural/demographic information transmitted during speech and typing
* Helping predict the spread of wildfires

## How do we do it?
Machine learning, natural language processing, deep leaning, and several other techniques using Python, Java, C/C++/C#, SQL/MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Spark and our very own GPUs.
