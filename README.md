Welcome to the MAGICS Lab at the University of San Francisco. We are a research lab that focuses on **M**achine Learning, **A**rtificial Intelligence, **G**ame **I**ntelligence, and **C**omputing at **S**cale.

## Who are we?
The MAGICS LAB was founded in 2018 by Drs. Brizan (Computer Science), Intrevado (Data Science), and Malensek (Computer Science) at the University of San Francisco. We meet weekly with undergraduate and graduate students to work on applied research.

## What do we do?
We work on projects that have great personal interest to us, including:
* Detecting Bias is News Organisations

Machine learning, natural language processing, deep leaning, and several other techniques using Python, Java, C/C++/C#, SQL/MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Spark and our very own GPUs.
