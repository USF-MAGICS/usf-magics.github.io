# MAGICS Lab

Welcome to the MAGICS Lab at the University of San Francisco. We are a research lab that focuses on **M**achine Learning, **A**rtificial Intelligence, **G**ame **I**ntelligence, and **C**omputing at **S**cale.

**Meetings**: In Spring of 2024, we meet most weeks on Monday from 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm in LS G12. (Also on [zoom](https://usfca.zoom.us/j/89554104082).) 

Meetings are open to the public and we encourage anyone to join: beginners, practitioners, researchers... all are welcome! Our meetings generally revolve around project updates, discussions, short tutorials, and coverage of the latest research in our fields of study.

This semester, we're working on Jaz Ku's project to determine and adjust the reading difficulty of text.

## What do we do?
We work on projects that have great personal interest to us, including:
* Detecting Bias is News Organisations
* Classifying Songs by Genre with Machine Learning
* Improving upon the Yelp recommendation engine for restaurants
* Analysing personal and cultural/demographic information transmitted during speech and typing
* Helping predict the spread of wildfires
* Visualizing Big Data

## How do we do it?
Machine learning, natural language processing, deep leaning, and several other techniques using Python, Java, C/C++/C#, SQL/MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Spark and our very own GPUs.
